# Mission Control OS — Master Build Plan

**Current Phase:** 2 (Reviewer Agents + Guardrails)
**Progress:** Phase 0: 100% | Phase 1: 100% | Phase 2: 98% | Phase 3 ~33% (Jarvis Mode complete, Wakanda + mode dispatch UI remaining)
**Active Worktrees:** none
**Blockers:** none
**Next Approval Gate:** ABAC policy source-of-truth — decide where mission-specific policy lives (Mission object? mode registry? Postgres)

---

## Phase 1 — Batman Mode MVP (Weeks 2–5)

### Objectives
- [x] FastAPI app + routes scaffolded
- [x] LangGraph BatmanGraph + BatmanLeadAgent built
- [x] DecomposerAgent — Claude API call, JSON parsing, task stamping (13 tests ✅)
- [x] Wire decomposer into batman_graph._decompose_node
- [x] Executor agent (backend/agents/executor.py)
- [x] React cockpit UI (cockpit.tsx + 3 components)
- [x] Approval queue (TaskApprovalCard + routes)
- [x] Integration test — full Batman workflow lifecycle (4 tests)

### Phase 1 Task Log
1. ✅ **DecomposerAgent** (`backend/agents/decomposer.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §3: mission objective → structured sub-tasks via Claude
   - 13 unit tests passing, all Claude calls mocked
   - Added: anthropic>=0.25.0, pytest-asyncio to pyproject.toml

2. ✅ **BatmanGraph wired** (`backend/agents/batman_graph.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §3–5: real LangGraph StateGraph with decompose → approve → execute → complete
   - DecomposerAgent injected into _decompose_node (no more hardcoded tasks)
   - Immutable state pattern (copy.copy on every node)
   - MAX_ITERATIONS=10 loop guard
   - 13 unit tests passing

3. ✅ **ExecutorAgent** (`backend/agents/executor.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §4–5: ABAC permission check → tool execute → cost track → memory store
   - 7 unit tests passing

4. ✅ **BatmanSupervisor** (`backend/agents/supervisor.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §3–5: orchestrates decompose + execute lifecycle
   - Wires all services together; used by FastAPI routes

5. ✅ **Routes rewired** (`backend/api/routes.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §6–8: all routes now go through BatmanSupervisor
   - New endpoints: /execute, /results, /cost, /memory
   - Full Batman approval gate enforced

6. ✅ **CostService model name prefix matching** — 2026-04-24
   - claude-opus-4-5 now resolves correctly to opus pricing tier

7. ✅ **React Cockpit UI** — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §6–8: Batman command center dashboard
   - `ui/pages/cockpit.tsx` — mission input, approval queue, execution log, cost bar
   - `ui/components/TaskApprovalCard.tsx` — per-task approve/reject
   - `ui/components/ExecutionLog.tsx` — scrollable task result log
   - `ui/components/CostTrackerWidget.tsx` — compact cost display

8. ✅ **Integration Test** — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §3–8: full Batman workflow lifecycle
   - `tests/integration/test_batman_workflow.py` — 4 tests (happy path, guardrail, 404, decomposer called)
   - SQLAlchemy upgraded 2.0.23 → 2.0.49 (Python 3.13 compatibility)

**Total tests: 56/56 passing (52 unit + 4 integration)**

### Known Tech Debt
- `ui/lib/api.ts` uses `/api` prefix — spec routes are root-level. Fix before Phase 2 UI work.

### Key Files
- `backend/agents/decomposer.py` ✅
- `backend/agents/batman_graph.py` ✅
- `backend/agents/executor.py` ✅
- `backend/agents/supervisor.py` ✅
- `backend/api/routes.py` ✅
- `db/schema.sql` ✅
- `ui/pages/cockpit.tsx` ✅
- `tests/integration/test_batman_workflow.py` ✅

## Phase 2 — Reviewer Agents + Guardrails (Weeks 6–7)

### Objectives
- [x] Implement Reviewer Agents (code, memory, security) — commit `166b6c6`
- [x] Cost alert service with hysteresis — commit `8c90f3c`
- [x] Wire ReviewGate into BatmanGraph between approval and execution
- [x] Wire CostAlertService.check into `_execute_task_node` after each cost track
- [x] ABAC policy source-of-truth decided (Option A: Mission-object-native)
- [x] `Mission.abac_policy` field + CreateMissionRequest plumb-through + Supervisor honors it
- [ ] ABAC enforcement at all decision points (tool_service → review_gate consolidation)
- [x] Persist review_results + cost_alerts to durable store (AuditService — SQLite in tests, Postgres in prod via DATABASE_URL)
- [x] Surface review_results + cost_alerts in the cockpit UI (ReviewPanel + AlertsPanel)

### Phase 2 Task Log
1. ✅ **Reviewer Agents** (`backend/agents/reviewers.py`) — commit `166b6c6`
   - Spec §6–8: CodeReviewer (injection + allow-list), MemoryReviewer (cross-mode prefix ban), SecurityReviewer (ABAC)
   - 21 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_reviewers.py`)

2. ✅ **CostAlertService** (`backend/services/cost_alert_service.py`) — commit `8c90f3c`
   - Spec §15–17: warning at 80% threshold, critical at 100%, 5% hysteresis band
   - Tested in isolation

3. ✅ **BatmanGraph Phase 2 wiring** — 2026-04-24
   - New node `_review_tasks_node` inserted between `await_approval` and `execute_task`
   - Routers renamed: `_should_execute` → `_should_execute_after_review` + new `_should_review`
   - State extended: `review_results`, `cost_alerts`
   - Constructor now accepts `review_gate`, `cost_alert_service`, `abac_policy`
   - Cost alerts fired from inside `_execute_task_node` after every successful tool track
   - 6 new integration tests (`tests/unit/test_batman_graph_phase2.py`)

4. ✅ **Mission-scoped ABAC policy** — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §12–14: ABAC policy scoped per Mission
   - `Mission.abac_policy: Optional[Dict]` added (shape: `{allowed_tools, forbidden_params}`)
   - `CreateMissionRequest.abac_policy` → stored on mission dict → passed to `Supervisor.execute_approved_tasks(abac_policy=...)`
   - When None, SecurityReviewer falls back to its service default
   - 5 new unit tests (`tests/unit/test_mission_abac_policy.py`)

**Total tests: 127/127 passing (121 unit + 6 integration)**
**UI: scaffold complete, `npx tsc --noEmit` clean**

5. ✅ **Next.js scaffold** — 2026-04-24
   - `ui/package.json` (Next 14.2.35, React 18.3.1, TS 5.4.5)
   - `ui/tsconfig.json` (strict, bundler resolution)
   - `ui/next.config.js`
   - Fixed 3 `.tsx` files that had Python triple-quote docstrings (ApprovalQueue, CostTracker, MissionGraph)
   - Updated `dashboard.tsx` to use new `missions.approve()` (dropped stale `tasks.*` import)
   - Typed all `missions.*` API methods with explicit return generics
   - `*.tsbuildinfo` added to gitignore

6. ✅ **Cockpit review + alerts surfacing** — 2026-04-24
   - `ReviewPanel` — per-task reviewer verdicts (code / memory / security), passed vs blocked with reasons
   - `AlertsPanel` — cost alerts with level badge (warning / critical), current/threshold, fired timestamp
   - Polls `/missions/:id/results` + `/missions/:id/alerts` every 3s alongside existing mission + cost polling
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean

7. ✅ **Audit persistence layer** — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §6–8 + §15–17: durable record of every review verdict and cost alert
   - New ORM tables: `ReviewResultRecord`, `CostAlertRecord` in `backend/db/models.py`
   - `backend/services/audit_service.py` — session-factory based, swappable between SQLite (tests) and Postgres (prod via `DATABASE_URL`)
   - Wired into `BatmanSupervisor.execute_approved_tasks` — best-effort writes (live workflow never breaks on persistence failure)
   - 11 new tests (8 unit on AuditService, 3 integration on Supervisor + AuditService end-to-end)

8. ✅ **Phase 2 cockpit smoke test** — 2026-04-24
   - `tests/integration/test_phase2_cockpit_smoke.py` — 2 tests
   - Walks every endpoint the cockpit polls (`/missions/:id/results`, `/cost`, `/alerts`, `/memory`) through ASGI transport — no real Anthropic key, no Postgres
   - Asserts `abac_policy` survives create→execute round-trip, alerts fire with low threshold, blocked tasks expose `review_results[]` for ReviewPanel

---

## Phase 3 — Jarvis & Wakanda Modes (Weeks 8–10)

### Mode → Business Mapping (CONFIRMED 2026-04-24)
- **Batman** = Vampire Sex / London X (artist work, approval-gated)
- **Jarvis** = Fractal Web Solutions (dev agency, command-execute)
- **Wakanda** = ATS / All the Smoke (label, mixed/selective approval)

### Objectives
- [x] Jarvis mode (command-execute, no approval) — `JarvisSupervisor` + `POST /missions/{id}/run`
- [ ] Wakanda mode (mixed, selective approval) — design TBD with Hotboxx-side workflow
- [ ] Mode switching + validation in cockpit UI

### Phase 3 Task Log
1. ✅ **JarvisSupervisor** (`backend/agents/jarvis_supervisor.py`) — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §9–11: single-shot decompose → review → execute → done
   - Shares ToolService / CostService / MemoryService / CostAlertService / AuditService with Batman supervisor (one cost+audit backplane per mission_id)
   - 6 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_jarvis_supervisor.py`) — happy path, injection block, cross-mode memory block, audit persistence, cost alerts, no-approval-methods invariant

2. ✅ **POST /missions/{id}/run route** — 2026-04-24
   - Spec §9: Jarvis single-shot lifecycle
   - Rejects Batman missions with 400 (must use approve+execute flow)
   - Mode-aware `create_mission`: Jarvis skips create-time decomposition (no premature Claude call, no orphan unapproved tasks)
   - 2 integration tests (`tests/integration/test_jarvis_route.py`)

**Total tests: 127/127 passing (121 unit + 6 integration)**

---

## Phase 4 — Memory Scoping & ABAC (Weeks 11–12)

### Objectives
- [ ] Full memory isolation per Mission
- [ ] Least-privilege ABAC system
- [ ] Role-based tool access

---

## Phase 5 — Polish & Launch (Week 13)

### Objectives
- [ ] Documentation + guides
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Deployment + monitoring

---

## Risks & What to Avoid

- [ ] **Swarm behavior** — Agents spinning up without coordination
- [ ] **Free-form agent chat** — Approval queue must be explicit
- [ ] **Cross-mode memory leakage** — Batman mode data isolated from Jarvis
- [ ] **Missing audit trail** — Every decision logged
- [ ] **Scope creep** — Stick to the 17-section spec

---

## Spec Reference

- **Full spec:** 17 sections, covers Batman/Jarvis/Wakanda modes, ABAC, memory, cost tracking
- **Key sections:**
  - 1–2: Mission Object + tool registry
  - 3–5: Batman mode flow
  - 6–8: Approval queue + guardrails
  - 9–11: Jarvis + Wakanda modes
  - 12–14: ABAC + memory scoping
  - 15–17: Launch + monitoring

---

## Next Human Approval Needed

**Before Phase 0 implementation:**
1. Confirm Pydantic Mission Object schema (spec section 1–2)
2. Approve folder structure
3. Approve tech stack (FastAPI, LangGraph, React, Postgres)
